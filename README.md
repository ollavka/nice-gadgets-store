## ❤️ Favorites & 🛒 Shopping Cart
The Favorites and Shopping Cart pages allow you to manage your preferences and purchases. Adding items to favorites and cart is easy, just click the corresponding buttons on the product card or on the product details page. The add item to favorites button works both ways, allowing you to manage your favorites list. To remove items from the cart, you need to go to the cart and click on the cross next to the item.  Also on the cart page you can select the quantity of goods of a certain product and place an order (checkout), after which all items from the cart will be removed. All your actions will be visualized with the help of pop-up notifications so that you are always aware of what is happening.<br />
